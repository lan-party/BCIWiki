# Contributing
Thank you for considering giving your time and effort to build [BCIWiki.org](https://BCIWiki.org)!

## Types of contributors
It doesn't take any special training to find new information and add it to the wiki. Some contributors, however, may bring additional skillsets they'd like to apply to this project. The list below isn't exhaustive so please reach out if you have another idea for how you'd like to help.
- *Developers* - website changes, automation scripts
- *Students & Enthusiasts* - data entry, web research
- *Neuro Researchers & Labs* - data entry, accuracy validation
- *Founders & Startup Teams* - data entry, content corrections

## Passive and active resource collection
One of the primary ways people give back to the wiki is by sharing web links and creating wiki pages to catalog them. If you're someone who's interested in the topic of brain-computer interfaces, you likely already run into references and links to all sorts of resources that would fit in perfectly on the wiki. Passively finding things like new neurotech startups, neuroscience research papers, datasets, YouTube channels, and more can be a great way to help out in the pursuit of keeping BCIWiki updated.

For taking a more active approach to online research, we'd recommend starting your search on social media or news platforms like LinkedIn, Reddit, Crunchbase, and Facebook. A few keywords that might be helpful in your search could be terms like "brain-computer interface" "neurotechnology", "EEG", "fMRI", or "deep brain stimulation".

### Now what?
The best thing you can do is become an editor and start adding pages yourself.
Alternatively, you can send us your web links to resources you think should be added and we'll do our best to review and incorporate that into the wiki when possible. You can share your recommendations from our [feedback form](https://bciwiki.org/Feedback/) or by reaching out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/3eqKb9bmFy).

## How to make your first edit
1. Request an editor account by reaching out to [landon@bciwiki.org](mailto:landon@bciwiki.org) or by sending a message in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/3eqKb9bmFy)
2. Select a data entry issue to work on OR suggest a new task
3. Create or edit a page according to our [editor guidelines](https://bciwiki.org/index.php?title=Editor_Guide)
4. Request feedback for your first few edits until you get the hang of things
5. Consider reviewing someone else's recent changes

## Issue/task tracking
Tasks related to data entry and all other work on BCIWiki.org should be tracked with [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/lan-party/BCIWiki/issues). Below are some issue categories to use.
- data entry
- web research
- custom site features
- site extensions
- data entry scripts
- web scraping scripts
- content generation scripts

## Things to get consensus on
- enforce invasive, noninvasive, and semi-invasive definitions and usage
- should structural imaging techniques be ignored?
- what makes sense to have on the wiki? / bci vs other neurotech (no pharma, no surgical robotics, no PNS implants, etc.)
- company table accuracy (application categories, imaging/stim techniques)
- what should a table of all BCI applications, application categories, and subcategories look like? where will that info come from?
